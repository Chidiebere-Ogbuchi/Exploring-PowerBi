In this tutorial, we build a beautiful report from Excel workbook to show sample financial report


## Case

Your manager wants to see a report on your latest sales figures. They've requested an executive summary of:

Which month and year had the most profit?

Where is the company seeing the most success (by country/region)?

Which product and segment should the company continue to invest in?


Using the sample finance workbook, hereâ€™s what the final report will look like!
